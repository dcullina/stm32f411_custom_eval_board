# STM32 Learning Sandbox

Project built from [stm32 template](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal)

My main goals with this project were to learn a little bit about embedded applications. For this project, I built a board (copying the hardware from [Phil's Lab](https://github.com/pms67)).
